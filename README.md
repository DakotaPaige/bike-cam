Bikewell (previously bike-cam) is a a smart dash-cam app that focuses on encouraging good behaviour for cyclists. The app incentivizes good habits while at the same time provides valuable data to both users and city planners in the effort to reduce collisions. Our first efforts are being deployed and tested in the Greater Vancouver area.

## Vanquish Collisions Hackathon

Project created during VANquish Collisions Hackathon (September 6 - September 8, 2018).  
The challenge: What interventions will move us more quickly towards our zero transportation related fatalities and serious injuries goal while encouraging active travel, especially for vulnerable road users such as seniors and children?
